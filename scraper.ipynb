    "**Key Points of the Script:**\n",
    "1. **WebDriver Setup**: It initializes a Chrome WebDriver, not headless by default but with an option commented to enable headless mode. The driver is set to open in fullscreen mode.\n",
    "2. **Job Scraping**: The function `scrape_jobs` navigates to LinkedIn job search results, automatically scrolling to load more entries and clicking on job cards to expand details. It continues until it gathers the desired number of job postings or reaches the end of available listings.\n",
    "3. **Data Extraction**: For each job listing, the script extracts job title, company name, location, job description, posted date, and listed date from the details pane. It handles cases where some details might be missing by filling in \"Not listed\" if necessary.\n",
    "4. **Analysis**: Converts the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame to facilitate data manipulation and analysis.\n",
    "5. **Graceful Shutdown**: Ensures the WebDriver is properly closed after scraping to free resources and avoid leftover processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Considerations**:\n",
    "- **Dynamic Content Handling**: Implements Selenium waits to manage dynamic content and ensure elements are loaded before interaction. Uses JavaScript execution for actions like scrolling and clicking, which can be more reliable on dynamic pages.\n",
    "- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling to manage exceptions during element interaction, including clicks that fail due to overlays or missing elements.\n",
    "- **Full Screen Mode**: The script runs Chrome in fullscreen mode by default, which can be useful for visibility during manual troubleshooting but is not typically needed in automated environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**:\n",
    "- As a caution, LinkedIn’s terms of service prohibit scraping, which could lead to account restrictions or bans if detected. This script assumes a small-scale, non-intrusive use case which typically avoids detection. However, it is important to consider these limitations and potential legal implications when automating interactions with web services."
