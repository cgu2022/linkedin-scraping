    "**Key Points of the Script:**\n",
    "1. **WebDriver Setup**: It initializes a headless Chrome driver.\n",
    "2. **Job Scraping**: The function `scrape_jobs` navigates the LinkedIn job search results, automatically scrolling to load more entries until it gathers the desired number of job postings or reaches the end.\n",
    "3. **Data Extraction**: For each job listing, the script extracts the job title, company name, location, and salary (if available). If salary isn't listed, it notes \"Not listed\".\n",
    "4. **Analysis**: Converts the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame to facilitate straightforward data manipulation and analysis.\n",
    "5. **Graceful Shutdown**: Ensures the WebDriver is properly closed after the scraping is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Considerations**:\n",
    "- **Dynamic Content**: Selenium waits are used to ensure that the page loads completely before attempting to find elements.\n",
    "- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling includes skipping over job listings that don't have all the expected fields.\n",
    "- **Headless Operation**: The script runs Chrome in headless mode for better performance, especially useful when running on servers or automated environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "This script is configured for educational purposes and assumes ethical use, with proper respect for LinkedIn's terms of service. For practical use, you'd need to ensure compliance with LinkedIn's data use policies.\n"
